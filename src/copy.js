text: My fingers feel along the rice paper pages as my eyes trace the inked lines for three characters: Yan Ji Ci.

text: In my imagination, the description would be short and basic, something along the lines of “youngest of three, born on a winter’s night in 1900 in Dong Yang city”. This volume was published in 1920 when my great-grandfather would have only been twenty years old. He had been born in the outskirts of Dongyang city to a farming family that barely earned enough money to send him to school. And so I was skeptical as to whether his family would have even been included in such a polished genealogy book. If my great-grandfather’s family were included in a printed genealogy record, I thought, Columbia University would surely have it. At 20,000 volumes, Columbia University boasts the largest collection of Chinese genealogical records in North America, with records dating as far back as the early 12th century.

text: These <i>Jia pu</i> are a kaleidoscope into everyday life, and each carefully compiled record became a new world that sprawled out in front of me. I was looking for something more fulfilling than standard family trees and ethnic percentages — I wanted short anecdotes and colorful pictures that narrated how my great-grandfather lived day-to-day. Though I ultimately did not uncover the story of my great-grandparents, unexpected and intriguing stories leapt off each page of the genealogies that I combed through.

poem: Sitting on the lone rock under the tree, there’s light dew between the grass.
My heart misses the one who has sat on this rock but they are no longer here.
Birds soar among the clouds, flying towards the south. The meandering mountain fill the quiet night as the clear, cool stream reflects the moonlight.
A light drift blowing southward hugs me faithfully. The river and sea reflects each other from afar.

text: When John Fairbank stepped onto the soil inof China in 1942, he was assistant to the American ambassador to China by day and special agent for Office of Strategic Services (the precursor of the Central Intelligence Agency) by night. Armed with a Nikon camera and rolls of film, the young Chinese Studies scholar’s initial mission was to set about compiling books and resources on the Japanese imperial forces to assist in the American war effort. Fairbank found himself befriending a number of Chinese alumna of the now-defunct Columbia University School of Library.

text: Fairbank’s most crucial partner was Yuan Tung-Li. Yuan graduated from Columbia with a graduate degree in History in 1922 (and was presented with a University of Medal for Excellence in 1935), he returned to Beijing the following year to serve as the inaugural Vice President of the Beijing National Library.

text: It wasn’t long before the Japanese Imperial Army bombed and surrounded Beijing proper. Universities across the country found themselves struggling to feed their faculty and students and tensions ran high as the country braced itself for a gruesome war. Yuan had sent three hundred cartons of rare books from the Beijing National Library to Shanghai French Concession for safekeeping in 1937. In 1942, Yuan began urgent preparation with Fairbank and Yoh Peter Liang-Mu, Columbia School of Library grad and librarian at the Shanghai Library, to keep these rare records safe from the destruction of war. While Yuan and Yoh organized the collections on the ground, Fairbank corresponded with American universities interested in collecting these rare and endangered Chinese collections.

text: In 1942, Fairbank, Yuan and Yoh began entreating the American Library Association (ALA) in hopes ofto asking the United States Department of State to purchase Chinese rare books and manuscripts in bulk; these documents would all serve as a part of the Sino-American war effort. The State Department eventually finally allocated $100,000 (equivalent to $1,300,000 today) to buy select collections of rare Chinese books and manuscripts. The three men spent the following months curating the collection and devising ways to circumvent Japanese detection by air and by water and ship them to the United States.

text: According to Dr. Wang many of the genealogies in the East Asian Studies Library arrived at Columbia during these first exchanges. In 1944, Columbia University was among the first to purchase Confucian classics, contemporary manuscripts, and other rare books from China. Since Yuan and Yoh were both alumni of the university, the president of Columbia Library Services gave them full rein of the transactions and the funds necessary to safely transport the chosen rare books and manuscripts to the shores of New York City.

text: Unbeknownst to Yuan, Yoh and Fairbank, a few decades later the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (commonly known as the Mormon Church) trained their sights on these shipments of genealogies. Unlike these three men, who sought to preserve the rich history recorded in Chinese jia pu, the Mormon Church had an agenda for these genealogies that can only be described as imperialistic.

text: The Family History Center (formerly known as Genealogical Society of Salt Lake City, Utah) is the genealogy arm of the Mormon Church and has a Granite Vault tucked 700 feet deep into the side of a canyon in Utah. For over a century Family History Center has actively collected millions of family records. One of the main tenets of the Mormon faith is proxy baptism— (also known as baptism for the dead). The Mormon Church justifies this practicebaptism for the dead with quotes from scripture (“Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all?”), claiming that the deceased possesses free agency to convert to Mormonism. The Church has compiled a list of 400 million names, all of whom have been baptized or is cleared for the rite those baptized or cleared for the rite.
