poem: Sitting on the lone rock under the tree, thereâ€™s light dew between the grass.
My heart misses the one who has sat on this rock but they are no longer here.
Birds soar among the clouds, flying towards the south. The meandering mountain fill the quiet night as the clear, cool stream reflects the moonlight.
A light drift blowing southward hugs me faithfully. The river and sea reflects each other from afar.
